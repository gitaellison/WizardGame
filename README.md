# WizardGame
There is a build.exe file in the Final Project folder(the main folder). That's the game itself, and as far as I understand it should run 
without  unity3D.
I you like want to open up project itself in the Unity 3D, you are likely to experience issues at import.
in that case, contact us, we will give you the access to unity cloud
